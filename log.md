# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## List of Projects:
- Learning Pytorch by porting the following [implementation]( https://github.com/emilwallner/Coloring-greyscale-images) from Keras.
- To be added...

### Day 0: March 9th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Set up a GCP account to do some deep learning. 

**Thoughts:** Done this before, but it seems there were some problems with permissions, authorizations etc. with my gcloud SDK client. It was horribly out of date. So fixed it up and got an instance up and running.

**Link to work:** Will add soon.

### Day 1: March 10th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Coded up an implementation in pytorch.  

**Thoughts:** 
- Looks like you need to initialize all the layers with trainable parameters inside `__init__` function. Otherwise, network doesn't automatically identify it's parameters. The functional implementation doesn't seem to be of much use in such a case. 
- Reworked the implementation; got it executing, but it's giving a weird output. Will need to fix it.

**Link to work:** Will add soon.
